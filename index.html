                <div class="bio-section padding-20">
                    <p> <span>Jakub</span>, as we can say, is the typical EU citizen and the reason about it is
                        simple. Have been born
                        in Italy from a Polish family which has Danish roots makes him a great mixture of different
                        cultures. A polyglot person speaking (almost) four languages such as English, Italian, Polish
                        and Danish. Skills learned from childhood which allows him to be able to adapt well to other
                        cultures and new environments around the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Pietrasanta</span> is the town where he was born and where he grew up in a multicultural
                        environment.
                        Jakub's childhood was surrounded by people coming from different nationalities with different
                        views of life
                        In that small Tuscanian city his languages skills were nealed between different spoken languages
                        and as a funny, but tragic when he was a child, the adeptness to speak all the languages at once
                        (called Esperanto). The reason? because his mind was processing all the inputs in mixed known to
                        his languages and the output was just a mix-in of the words first pop-ups in his mind in the
                        language inside him. Regardless of the meaning of those words. A funny situation but tragic for
                        whom was on the other side of the conversation. For a period actually, only his parents were
                        able to understand him as they also speak many languages. The childhood he passed was a culture
                        adventure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Passionate</span> about sport, he is playing basketball and from his youth, been involved
                        in training
                        with teams and practicing on the professional level until unfortunate injuries and age issues.
                        In general, he is an active person between different sports as cycling, running, gym, winter
                        sports, etc. Loves to watch the NBA. Big fun of Dirk Nowitzki but the GOAT MJ is just the best
                        of the best.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Technologies</span> are a passion he cultivated from he was a kid, from the moment the
                        father brought
                        home the first family PC. One of those PC's which to start you were in need to insert a very big
                        disk and the hard-disk capacity was like 7gb. A big piece of technology for the time but now a
                        museum artifact. Jakub started from there to be curious about the technologies and their
                        functionalities. He built computers (gaming machines) sometimes with no successful behaviors but
                        always with the passion to solve and discover why was not working and how to fix it.
                        That landed him to touch the settings of different OS and make his hands dirty with new IT
                        mechanics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Likes</span> to learn new skills and get knowledge about the world around him. Has a
                        passion for
                        history to be able to understand the past of humankind and likes Xi-Fi to have an eye into the
                        future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Cakes</span> as last but not least, not only to eat them but also to cook them.
                        Chocolate cakes are his passions but when tiramisu comes from his hands, his friends usually
                        asking for another portion until they with a sad voice ask for another tiramisu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is <span>Jakub</span>, in general, an open-minded guy, with passions for technologies and
                        many other
                        things. Curious about life and new cultures. Ready to take the next challenge which could change
                        his life.
